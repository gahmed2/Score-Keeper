# Score-Keeper
This is the second project in Google Udacity Scholarship for Android Basics Challenge.

This project is dedicated for recording results for two teams are playing "American Football", so you can keep tracking for each point scored during the match.

The power of "styles.xml" made "activity_main.xml" file very concise by avoiding repetition of style attributes for each view.

Updated version of this project for:
a) Using "dimens.xml to avoid hardcoded dimensions in "styles.xml"
b) Optimizing CPU usage by defining target view once in onCreate method.
c) Using Unary operators like "++" and "+=" to make the code more concise.
d) Fixing activity life cycle to prevent reseting scores when switching from portrait view to landscape view.
